# devinci_auto_presence
A little program to automatically check presence for you

*How it works*

- Program logs in into your account on devinci portail website
- If there is a presence it will check it, and wait until your next class
- If presence is closed, it will wait until your next class
- if presence is not opened, it will check every x seconds (delay you define) if it got opened, and when it opens, it checks it
